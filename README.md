# PROG 01: Crunch Time (Calorie Burner)

The application has a simple interface and supports four exercises: push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks, and jogging. The user can enter the amount of repetition (for the first two exercises) or the amount of duration (for the latter two exercises), click the “Enter” button, and find out the amount of calorie expense of that exercise. This value is shown at the top, and simultaneously, a few other values also show up under the other exercises, indicating the amount of those exercises that the user can do to burn the equivalent amount of calories. The user can click the “Clear” button at any time to reset all fields.
The user can also enter a desired amount of calorie expense, click “Enter”, and find out how many of each exercise he or she can do to burn that amount of calories. Again, the values of calories show up under each exercise, and the user can click “Clear” at any time to reset the field and do another search.
